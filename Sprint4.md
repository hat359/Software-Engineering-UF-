Description of the project-

The application InfoGator was created to provide helpful information to students who comes to a new and unfamiliar place and are unaware to the local systems and processes, thus facing a lot of problems in their everyday work. This application hopes to make students more familiar with the local systems. The main domains which are covered in this application are travel, academics, and finance in the following ways:
•	Travel
This portal helps the students by providing guidelines required for travelling from one place to another. This is provided in the form of three steps, each of which covers the various stages of travelling, including fixing mode of travel, choosing location, finding nearby places, and also getting answers to questions related to the travel.
•	Academics
This portal allows the students to get material on the academic requirements and also give recommendations and ratings of the teachers which can help them make better decisions as to which course to pick and all based on it.
•	Finance
This portal helps the people understand the functioning of the financial system and familiarize them with the available resources including setting up and management of bank accounts, getting health insurance, and other financial aids.
